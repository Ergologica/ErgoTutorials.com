1 - In this tutorial we will download SafeW, create one wallet, restore another and use both wallets.

2 - The first thing we will do is to enter SafeW's Github.

3 - We go to releases to download the latest version.

4 - Unzip.

5 - We go to manage extensions and in developer mode we go to the unzipped upload option. We choose the folder we just downloaded.

6 - The extension will appear immediately. 

7 - We fix the extension to have it always at hand.

8 - We open the extension. Immediately the disclaimer appears, if we agree we click on use Safew. 

9 - Here we will be able to create a new wallet, restore an existing one and we will also be able to restore one to sign the transaction with the wallet for IOS or Android.

10 - We will create a new wallet.

11 - We choose a name, a background color and the number of seed words we want for our wallet. We must write it down and keep it in a safe place.

12 - Enter a password and click on add wallet.

13 - We have now created it correctly. Here we can see the address of our wallet.

14 - In order to make a transaction from this wallet, we will send 0.2 ERG from another wallet.

15 - Once we have the ERG we will make a transaction to test the wallet. 

16 - We indicate the recipient's address. 

17 - We can write the ERG we want to send or directly, as in our case, check the box to send all and click on send.

18 - Here we can see the summary of the transaction, and if we agree we sign with our password.

19 - Here we are shown the list of transactions. This corresponds to the first transaction where we receive the initial 0.2 ERG. 

20 - We go back to SafeW and we can see that the second transaction appears, where this time we send 0.2 ERG.

21 - The transaction is still unconfirmed and a few minutes later it is confirmed.

22 - We can see that our wallet has been left with the balance at 0 ERG.

23 - Now what we will do is to restore a wallet to sign transactions with the wallet for IOS or Android.

24 - We choose the name, a background color and type the address of the wallet we want to restore and click on add wallet.

25 - Here we can see the two wallets.

26 - We are going to make a shipment from the restored wallet.

27 - Enter the recipient's address, which in our case will be the wallet we created earlier. 

28 - We write the total we want to send, in our case 0.1 ERG.

29 - Click on ErgoPay and the QR code will appear for scanning from our mobile application on IOS or Android.

30 - Once the payment has been made from the mobile, we return to the home page and we can see how the pending transaction appears in both wallets, since one is the one that sends and the other is the one that is about to receive the shipment.

31 - After a few minutes we can see that the transaction has been successfully completed.
