1 - In this tutorial we will see how to verify NFT artists in Ergo.

2 - Regardless of the platform you use to bid or buy, a recommendation is to first inform yourself about the project on Discord, Twitter or the project website.

3 - If you decide to bid or buy an NFT on the Ergo auction house it is important that you verify the minting address of each artist.

4 - In each auction we will find 3 addresses. At the top it indicates the artist's minting address, it appears as "by". This address must exactly match the one indicated by the project. We could say that the authenticity of the NFT is marked by this address. If this address matches the one that appears as the artist's mint address, we are dealing with a true NFT.
 
5 - The other two addresses that appear at the bottom may or may not coincide with the minting address, that will depend on the person who is selling the NFT, since it can be sold by its creator or by another person who has previously bought it.

6 - The seller address indicates the seller of the NFT.

7 - The bidder address tells us the person who made the last bid for this NFT. 

8 - Let's see everything much more clearly with an example from the Ergo auction house. The first one we will go to verify is the artist ERGYOROI.

9 - We open twitter and look for the artist.

10 - We visit their website and at the bottom we can find their minting address.

11 - With this simple step we can verify if this NFT has been minted by the artist or by a scammer. In this way we are verifying the authenticity of an NFT before the bid or purchase. As can be seen, the addresses do not match and in this case we are facing a false NFT.

12 - As you can see, it could not be easier to verify a work, in this way you are making sure not to be cheated on any NFT platform on the market, whether it is Ergo, Cardano or any chain. Make sure for yourself and learn first hand about each NFT project.

13 - Below we can find two NFTs that do coincide with the ERGYOROI artist's mint address.

14 - We are going to check another artist who provides us with his twitter account, in this case Erg 3D coins.

15 - As we can see in the twitter account, it clearly indicates its minting address.

16 - This NFT has been minted by the artist.

17 - The next one we will check is ERGkleure, we visit their twitter account.

18 - In this case, the artist has in his profile the link to all his active auctions.

19 - In the case of wanting to bid or buy an NFT and not finding the minting address of the project through any of its social networks, the ideal is to ask the community through twitter or Discord, they will surely help you.
