1 - In this tutorial we will configure ErgoTipperBot to be able to send and receive tips on twitter and at the end we will send a tip to its creator Luivatra.

2 - The first thing we will do is enter Twitter and search for the user @ErgoTipperBot

3 - To start the configuration we must send the bot a private message.

4 - In a short time he will respond to us with the instructions that we must follow.

5 - We will write the message !start and send it.

6 - It tells us that the wallet has been started correctly and it will give us a password.

7 - The next step will be to write the message !address and we will send it.

8 - It will show us the address of our new wallet.

9 - We must copy that address and we will go to our usual wallet to make a first ERG shipment. At least we must send 0.00115 ERG.

10 - We will send 0.5 ERG from Yoroi.

11 - Once the transaction is confirmed, we go back to twitter and write the message !balance.

12 - There it will indicate that our balance is 0.5 ERG.

13 - Here we can see all the coins and tokens that it supports.

14 - Now we will change the password that the bot has given us. We must write the message !changepw followed by the current password and the new password.

15 - It tells us that the password has been changed correctly.

16 - Finally we will use the tool created by Luivatra and send him a tip.

17 - To send the tip we must write !tip, the amount we want and the name of the currency or token in a response to a tweet that you think deserves a tip. You must tag @ErgoTipperBot

18 - Any remaining text will be stored in the transaction database for both of you to view later.
