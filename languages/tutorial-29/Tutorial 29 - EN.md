1 - In this tutorial we will go through the process to participate as a watcher in the Rosen Bridge.

2 - The first thing we will do is go to Rosen's website.

3 - Once on the website we click to go to their GitHub.

4 - On the other hand, we download Docker from the official website, if we do not have it installed on our computer and install it.

5 - We open a terminal and clone the repository on our computer.

6 - We access the watcher directory.

7 - We create our environment file and configure our parameters.

8 - We set the necessary permissions and create the local.yaml file in the config directory.

9 - We set the 707 permission for the log directory, this step is only necessary on Mac.

10 - I copy the structure of the local.yaml file and modify the values by my own, seed phrase and current block height. The rest I don't need to modify it.

11 - We pull the Docker image.

12 - Finally we run the container.

13 - We go to our browser and open localhost:3030

14 - Remember to have the minimum required Ergo balances and the Rosen token.
