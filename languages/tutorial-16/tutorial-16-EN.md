1 - In this tutorial we will see how to use ErgoDex with the Nautilus Wallet connector. 

2 - If you have used ErgoDex with the Yoroi connector in the past, as in our case, the first thing to do is to go to the Yoroi wallet and disconnect the connector.

3 - Inside the wallet go to the Dapp Connector section and disconnect it.

4 - The next thing we will do is enter the ErgoDex website.

5 - As soon as we enter the page, the Nautilus Wallet connector will open.

6 - We will go to the restore wallet option. 

7 - We will give it a name and it will ask us to write our recovery phrase.

8 - Finally we write our spending password and click on confirm. 

9 - We can now see our wallet. In our case we have 1 ERG and 1000 NETA.

10 - We can see that ErgoDex still recognizes our Yoroi wallet so we will reload the page and immediately we will get the Nautilus connector.

11 - We connect our wallet.

12 - Here we can choose which address we want to use. We choose the address where we have the ERG and NETA.

13 - After a few seconds, it shows the balance of our wallet. 

14 - We are going to make a swap. Here we can see all the available tokens.

15 - We choose to swap 1000 NETA for ERG. We will get 7.93 ERG.

16 - Click on swap.

17 - Here we can see the values of the transaction before confirming the swap. If we agree we click on confirm.

18 - The Nautilus connector will open to sign the transaction with our spending password. 

19 - The transaction has been completed and can be viewed in the explorer.

20 - We can see that the transaction is unconfirmed. A few minutes later it is confirmed.

21 - We go back to ErgoDex and we can see that our balance has changed from 1 ERG to 8.93 ERG.

22 - We open Nautilus to confirm the balance of our wallet. After a few seconds it will update and show us the total we were expecting. The swap has been successful.
