1 - In this tutorial we are going to use Python to interact with the Ergo blockchain, we will create 1000 units of a token.

2 - To carry out this tutorial we must have Java 8 or higher installed and install ergpy.

3 - We can install Java from the website.

4 - To install ergpy we must write the following in our terminal.

5 - Once we have everything installed, we will see the code of our Python file.

6 - For our example to work we are only going to need 9 simple lines of code.

7 - To carry out this tutorial we are going to need to write the seed phrase of the address with which we are going to send, for this reason I recommend that you carry out the tests with an address that you have ergos but is not your main address.

8 - The first thing will be to import what is necessary.

9 - To carry out this example it is not necessary that we have a node running in our system, we will use the following one.

10 - Now we will configure our seed phrase.

11 - The rest of the values will be entered manually when our application is running.

12 - We print on the screen the result of having called the create token function.

12.5 - We run our script and enter the data to create the token.

13 - We check in the browser that our token has been created correctly.
