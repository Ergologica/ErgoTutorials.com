1 - In this tutorial we are going to use Python to interact with the Ergo blockchain, we will send the amount of 0.1 ERG.

2 - To carry out this tutorial we must have Java 8 or higher installed and install ergpy.

3 - We can install Java from the website.

4 - To install ergpy we must write the following in our terminal.

5 - Once we have everything installed, we will see the code of our Python file.

6 - For our example to work we are only going to need 7 simple lines of code, in which we will configure everything related to sending.

7 - To carry out this tutorial we are going to need to write the seed phrase of the address with which we are going to send, for this reason I recommend that you carry out the tests with an address that you have ergos but is not your main address.

8 - The first thing will be to import what is necessary.

9 - To carry out this example it is not necessary that we have a node running in our system, we will use the following one.

10 - Now we will configure the values to make the shipment.

11 - Seed phrase of our address to make the shipment, the address that receives the shipment and the amount that we are going to send.

12 - We print on the screen the result of having called the simple_send function.

12.5 - We run our Python file.

13 - We check in the browser that our transaction has been carried out correctly.
